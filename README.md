Scraping Data about Agricultural Land Dedications in the City and County of Honolulu

### Overview
Tax incentives are one of the most common mechanisms of governmental support of the financial viability of agricultural operations. 
Many counties, and every state but Michigan, have processes to enable farmers to dedicate their land to agricultural use for a given time period and receive and property tax break. 
These are often known as 'differential assessments' as the land is taxed at a different rate (i.e., agricultural use value) than the fair market value.

Revised Ordinances of Honolulu [Sec. 8-7.3](http://www.honolulu.gov/rep/site/ocs/roh/ROH_Chapter_8a_5-9_.pdf) outlines the process for the Dedication of Lands for Agricultural Use.


Sec. 8-7.3 outlines that a protion of land may be dedicated for a period of either 5 or 10 years, and will be taxed a 3% or 1%, respectively, of its fair market value.
**Dedicated areas** (which are not to inlcude the footprint of any residential homesite) "**shall remain in substantial and continuous agricultural use**." 
With "agricultural use of land" **defined as the "active use of the land for the production of agricultural products**." to "include such products as floricultural, horticultural, viticultural, aquacultural, forestry,
nut, coffee, dairy, livestock, poultry, bee, animal, tree farm, animals raised by grazing and pasturing, and any other
farm, agronomic, or plantation products." 

In 2018, there are over 1300 agricultural dedications across the island of Oahu. 
The extent to which these are in "substaintial and continuous agricultural use" is unknown.

This project aims to:

1. Compile historical agricultural dedication data.
2. Collect (scrape) public tax record data of currently dedicated parcels.
3. Quantify the total tax incentive provided by the City and County of Honolulu through the agricultural dedication process.
4. Map the existing dedications and assess their distribution
5. Begin exploring automated imagery anaylsis processing as a means to assess ""substaintial and continuous agricultural use".
