## Data Collection Strategy

### Primary Data Sources:
1. **Honolulu:** PDF reports + QPublic web scraping (established)
2. **Hawaii:** County tax office website + QPublic
3. **Maui:** County RPA forms + QPublic database
4. **Kauai:** County assessment office + QPublic

### Common Platforms:
- All counties use QPublic system for parcel data
- Each has county-specific PDF/report formats
- Application forms available online

### Challenges:
- No standardized data format across counties
- Different dedication period options
- Varying assessment methodologies
- Different application deadlines and requirements
