## üìä Critical Differences

### Application Deadlines

| County | Deadline | Flexibility |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Honolulu | None | ‚úÖ Rolling applications |
| Hawaii | None | ‚úÖ Rolling applications |
| Maui | September 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Annual deadline |
| Kauai | July 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Annual deadline |

### Minimum Requirements

| County | Land Use | Income | Production |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Honolulu** | ‚â•75% of usable land | Revenue-generating | Active production required |
| **Hawaii** | Not specified | **$2,000/year** | Proof required |

## üîç Policy Trends

### 1. **Tightening Requirements**
Hawaii County's 2023 reforms specifically target preventing abuse by "gentleman farmers" who claim tax benefits without genuine agricultural production. This sets a precedent other counties may follow.

### 2. **Modernization Efforts**
- **Kauai:** Ordinance No. 1132 requires all landowners to file new petitions
- **Maui:** Under review for consistency and uniformity in valuation
- **Hawaii:** Income verification requirements strengthen compliance

### 3. **Incentive Structure Evolution**
All counties use longer dedication periods to provide greater tax benefits, but mechanisms vary:
- **Honolulu:** Fixed percentage reduction (clear, predictable)
- **Hawaii:** Multiple program options (flexible, complex)
- **Maui:** Progressive discounts (encourages maximum commitment)
- **Kauai:** Single option (simple, limited)

## üí° Major Insights

### What Works Well

**‚úÖ Clear Requirements (Honolulu & Hawaii)**
- Honolulu's 75% land use threshold is measurable
- Hawaii's $2,000 income minimum is verifiable
- Both provide clear compliance standards

**‚úÖ Program Diversity (Hawaii)**
- Short-term (3yr) option for new farmers
- Long-term (10yr) option for established operations
- Community Food Sustainability program for specific goals

**‚úÖ Long-Term Incentives (Maui)**
- 20-year option encourages multi-generational farming
- Progressive discounts reward sustained commitment

### What Needs Improvement

**‚ö†Ô∏è Transparency Issues**
- Kauai doesn't publish specific assessment rates
- Maui's requirements not clearly documented
- Assessment calculation methods vary widely

**‚ö†Ô∏è Compliance Monitoring**
- No county publicly details compliance verification methods
- Unclear how "substantial and continuous use" is monitored
- Limited public data on violation rates or penalties

**‚ö†Ô∏è Standardization Gaps**
- No uniform definition of "agricultural production"
- Different deadline structures create confusion
- Assessment methods not comparable across counties

## üìà Recommendations

### For Policymakers

**1. STANDARDIZE CORE REQUIREMENTS**
- Adopt uniform definition of qualifying agricultural activity
- Establish consistent minimum production/income standards
- Create comparable assessment methodologies

**2. IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY**
All counties should publicly publish:
- Exact assessment calculation formulas
- Minimum income/production requirements
- Compliance monitoring procedures
- Annual compliance statistics

**3. ENHANCE FLEXIBILITY**
- Consider Hawaii's multi-program model
- Offer both short-term (3-5yr) and long-term (10-20yr) options
- Allow rolling applications where feasible

**4. STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT**
- Adopt measurable compliance standards (like Hawaii's $2,000)
- Implement regular audits and site visits
- Publish violation and penalty data

**5. MODERNIZE DATA SYSTEMS**
- Create unified statewide database
- Enable cross-county analysis
- Improve public data access

### For Farmers/Landowners

**1. HONOLULU BEST FOR:**
- Established farmers seeking clear, predictable benefits
- Those wanting flexible application timing
- Properties with well-documented agricultural use

**2. HAWAII BEST FOR:**
- New farmers (3-year short-term option)
- Community food producers (special program)
- Those with documented income records

**3. MAUI BEST FOR:**
- Long-term multi-generational operations
